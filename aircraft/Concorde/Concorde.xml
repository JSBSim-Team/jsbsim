        This model was created using publicly available data, publicly available
        technical reports, textbooks, and guesses. It contains no proprietary or
        restricted data. If this model has been validated at all, it would be
        only to the extent that it seems to "fly right", and that it possibly
        complies with published, publicly known, performance data (maximum speed,
        endurance, etc.). Thus, this model is meant for educational and entertainment
        purposes only.

        This simulation model is not endorsed by the manufacturer. This model is not
        to be sold.

          AOA : min -5.5 deg (above Mach 1), max 16.5 deg.
          Vortex above the entire wing creates lift at low speed and high AOA.
          Ground effect at landing : downwash of the air betweeen the wing and the ground.
          Delta wing provides a great deal of lift at Mach speed, with very little drag.

          Initial pitch at rotation is 13.5 deg.
          Cockpit is very noisy until nose is streamlined.
          Climb rate is slowly increased from 1500 to 3000 ft/s.
          Best lift-over-drag ratio over 300 kt.
          At takeoff, center of gravity is 51-52%, 58% at Mach 2.04.
          At Mach 1.3, inlet-guide ramps lower to slow down the intake air.
          At Mach 1.7 the afterburners are turned off, and the non-bypass engines
          are able to increase to Mach 2.04 (1150 kt)
          with about half the fuel flow.
          At cruise speed, the air entering the engines is reduced by intake
          ramps to 500 kt. This drop in intakes provides 45% of thrust, the
          engines 50%, and the convergent/divergent effect of the nozzle and
          stowed thrust reversers, 5%.

            (incident report, 13 june 2003) :

          The fuel tanks are arranged in 3 groups : the left main transfer group,
          the right main transfer and the trim transfer. The left and right main
          transfer groups store fuel in the wings and sections of the center fuselage,
          and both groups are comprised of 3 main tanks, which supply 2 collector
          tanks per group, from which the engines are fed.

          The collector tanks on the right main transfer group are tanks 3 and 4,
          which feed engines 3 and 4 respectively. The main fuel transfer system
          transfers fuel from the main transfer tanks to the collector tanks at
          a rate sufficiently high to ensure that the collectors tanks are always
          maintained in a near full condition.

          The lift curve (delta wing) shifts downwards, temporarily at Mach 1.06, and completely near Mach 1.65.

          Differences of XB-70 :
          - cruise Mach 3 at 70,000 feet.
          - wider canards.
          - wingtips fold from 0 deg at Mach 0.75 to 65.70 deg at Mach 1.5 (transonic 25.30 deg).

             ORIGIN (0,0,0) is at NOSE.

             Center of gravity :
             - level at wing level : -1/4 of max external fuselage height (130 in.).
             - 51.7%, inside corridor of C0 (maximum takeoff load)
               => real C0 starts over front gear location (18.7 m).

             Aero refence point :
             - level at wing level : -1/8 of max external fuselage height (130 in.).
             - back of center of gravity reduces autopilot roll (step back at supersonic cruise).
               It has been found that 200 inches behind CG reduces AUTOPILOT ROLL.
               => real at Mach 2 is 62% of C0.

             Eye point location : length from nose to cockpit (24 ft),
