# deploy the plugin

The BuildPlugin.bat allows you to create the plugin using the BuildTools. 

This avoids the need to first set up a project and then create a deployment using the packaging function under the plugins.

The script comes from the project:
https://github.com/Sixze/ALS-Refactored
and is quite generally applicable.

Note: No instance of the engine being used should be open.

# usage
1. change the number of the engine version you want to use and maybe the output path.
2. execute
3. wait for success
4. if fail search error and repair
5. repeat 1.
