  This is an output file that can be used to get a data file that
  is almost in Google Earth "KML" file format.  To run JSBSim in standalone
  mode and using this file, type (for example):

  src/jsbsim --script=scripts/c1723.xml --logdirectivefile=kml_output

  The first column of data must be removed (it is the elapsed simulation time
  in seconds). Removing the first column of data can be done as follows:

  cut -d, -f2- GroundTrack.kml.csv  > GroundTrack2.kml

  The first row containing the column headers should be removed, too, for
  use in Google Earth (edit GroundTrack2.kml in the above example).
  
  Then, you can concatenate the Pre- and Post-fix files to make a complete
  KML file you can drop into Google Earth:
  
  cat Prefix.kml GroundTrack2.kml Postfix.kml > FinalGroundTrack.kml
