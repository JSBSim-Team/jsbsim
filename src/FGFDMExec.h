HISTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/17/98   JSB   Created
7/31/99     TP   Added RunIC function that runs the sim so that every frame
                 begins with the IC values from the given FGInitialCondition
                 object and dt=0.

CLASS DOCUMENTATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%*/

/** Encapsulates the JSBSim simulation executive.
    This class is the executive class through which all other simulation classes
    are instantiated, initialized, and run. When integrated with FlightGear (or
    other flight simulator) this class is typically instantiated by an interface
    class on the simulator side.

    At the time of simulation initialization, the interface
    class creates an instance of this executive class. The
    executive is subsequently directed to load the chosen aircraft specification
    file:

    @code{.cpp}
    fdmex = new FGFDMExec( ... );
    result = fdmex->LoadModel( ... );
    @endcode

    When an aircraft model is loaded, the config file is parsed and for each of
    the sections of the config file (propulsion, flight control, etc.) the
    corresponding Load() method is called (e.g. FGFCS::Load()).

    Subsequent to the creation of the executive and loading of the model,
    initialization is performed. Initialization involves copying control inputs
    into the appropriate JSBSim data storage locations, configuring it for the
    set of user supplied initial conditions, and then copying state variables
    from JSBSim. The state variables are used to drive the instrument displays
    and to place the vehicle model in world space for visual rendering:

    @code{.cpp}
    copy_to_JSBsim(); // copy control inputs to JSBSim
    fdmex->RunIC(); // loop JSBSim once w/o integrating
    copy_from_JSBsim(); // update the bus
    @endcode

    Once initialization is complete, cyclic execution proceeds:

    @code{.cpp}
    copy_to_JSBsim(); // copy control inputs to JSBSim
    fdmex->Run(); // execute JSBSim
    copy_from_JSBsim(); // update the bus
    @endcode

    JSBSim can be used in a standalone mode by creating a compact stub program
    that effectively performs the same progression of steps as outlined above
    for the integrated version, but with two exceptions. First, the
    copy_to_JSBSim() and copy_from_JSBSim() functions are not used because the
    control inputs are handled directly by the scripting facilities and outputs
    are handled by the output (data logging) class. Second, the name of a script
    file can be supplied to the stub program. Scripting (see FGScript) provides
    a way to supply command inputs to the simulation:

    @code{.cpp}
    FDMExec = new JSBSim::FGFDMExec();
    FDMExec->LoadScript( ScriptName ); // the script loads the aircraft and ICs
    result = FDMExec->Run();
    while (result) { // cyclic execution
      result = FDMExec->Run(); // execute JSBSim
    }
    @endcode

    The standalone mode has been useful for verifying changes before committing
    updates to the source code repository. It is also useful for running sets of
    tests that reveal some aspects of simulated aircraft performance, such as
    range, time-to-climb, takeoff distance, etc.

    <h3>JSBSim Debugging Directives</h3>

    This describes to any interested entity the debug level
    requested by setting the JSBSIM_DEBUG environment variable.
    The bitmasked value choices are as follows:
    - <b>unset</b>: In this case (the default) JSBSim would only print
       out the normally expected messages, essentially echoing
       the config files as they are read. If the environment
       variable is not set, debug_lvl is set to 1 internally
    - <b>0</b>: This requests JSBSim not to output any messages
       whatsoever
    - <b>1</b>: This value explicity requests the normal JSBSim
       startup messages
    - <b>2</b>: This value asks for a message to be printed out when
       a class is instantiated
    - <b>4</b>: When this value is set, a message is displayed when a
       FGModel object executes its Run() method
    - <b>8</b>: When this value is set, various runtime state variables
       are printed out periodically
    - <b>16</b>: When set various parameters are sanity checked and
       a message is printed out when they go out of bounds

    <h3>Properties</h3>
    @property simulator/do_trim (write only) Can be set to the integer equivalent to one of
                                tLongitudinal (0), tFull (1), tGround (2), tPullup (3),
                                tCustom (4), tTurn (5). Setting this to a legal value
                                (such as by a script) causes a trim to be performed. This
                                property actually maps toa function call of DoTrim().
