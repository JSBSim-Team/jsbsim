/** Abstract class that provide functions that are generic to all the outputs
    that are directed to a file. A new class derived from FGOutputFile should
    be created for each file format that JSBSim is able to output.

    This class provides all the machinery necessary to manage the file naming
    including the sequence in which the file should be opened then closed. The
    logic of SetStartNewOutput() is also managed in this class. Derived class
    should normally not need to reimplement this method. In most cases, derived
    classes only need to implement the methods OpenFile(), CloseFile() and
    Print().
