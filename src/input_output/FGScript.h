/** Encapsulates the JSBSim scripting capability.
    <h4>Scripting support provided via FGScript.</h4>

    <p>There is support for scripting provided in the FGScript
    class. Commands are specified using the <em>Scripting
    Directives for JSBSim</em>. The script file is in XML
    format. A test condition (or conditions) can be set up in an event in a
    script and when the condition evaluates to true, the specified
    action[s] is/are taken. An event can be <em>persistent</em>,
    meaning that at every time the test condition first evaluates to true
    (toggling from false to true) then the specified <em>set</em> actions take
    place. An event can also be defined to execute or evaluate continuously
    while the condition is true. When the set of tests evaluates to true for a given
    condition, an item may be set to another value. This value may
    be a value, or a delta value, and the change from the
    current value to the new value can be either via a step action,
    a ramp, or an exponential approach. The speed of a ramp or exponential
    approach is specified via the time constant. Here is an example
    illustrating the format of the script file:

    @code
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<runscript name="C172-01A takeoff run">
  <!--
    This run is for testing the C172 altitude hold autopilot
  -->

  <use aircraft="c172x"/>
  <use initialize="reset00"/>
  <run start="0.0" end="3000" dt="0.0083333">

      <set name="fcs/mixture-cmd-norm" value="0.87" action="FG_RAMP" tc ="0.5"/>
      <set name="propulsion/magneto_cmd" value="3"/>
      <set name="propulsion/starter_cmd" value="1"/>
    </event>

    <event name="set heading hold">
      <!-- Set Heading when reach 5 ft -->
      <notify/>
      <condition>

      </condition>

    </event>

      <!-- Set Autopilot for 20 ft -->
      <notify/>

      </condition>
      <set name="ap/altitude_setpoint" value="100.0" action="FG_EXP" tc ="2.0"/>
      <set name="ap/altitude_hold" value="1"/>
      <set name="fcs/flap-cmd-norm" value=".33"/>
    </event>

    <event name="set autopilot 2" persistent="true">
      <!-- Set Autopilot for 6000 ft -->
      <notify/>
      <condition>
        aero/qbar-psf > 5
      </condition>
      <set name="ap/altitude_setpoint" value="6000.0"/>
    </event>

    <event name="Time Notify">
      <notify/>
      <condition> sim-time-sec >= 500 </condition>
    </event>

    <event name="Time Notify">
      <notify/>
      <condition> sim-time-sec >= 1000 </condition>
    </event>

  </run>

</runscript>
    @endcode

    The first line must always be present - it identifies the file
    as an XML format file. The second line
    identifies this file as a script file, and gives a descriptive
    name to the script file. Comments are next, delineated by the
    &lt;!-- and --&gt; symbols. The aircraft and initialization files
    to be used are specified in the &quot;use&quot; lines. Next,
    comes the &quot;run&quot; section, where the conditions are
    described in &quot;event&quot; clauses.</p>
