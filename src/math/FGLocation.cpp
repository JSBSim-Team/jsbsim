FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This class encapsulates an arbitrary position in the globe with its accessors.
It has vector properties, so you can add multiply ....

HISTORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/04/2004   MF    Created
11/01/2011   ORT   Encapsulated ground callback code in FGLocation and removed
                   it from FGFDMExec.
