/** Encapsulates various uncategorized scheduled functions.
    Pilot sensed accelerations are calculated here. This is used
    for the coordinated turn ball instrument. Motion base platforms sometimes
    use the derivative of pilot sensed accelerations as the driving parameter,
    rather than straight accelerations.

    The theory behind pilot-sensed calculations is presented:

    For purposes of discussion and calculation, assume for a minute that the
    pilot is in space and motionless in inertial space. She will feel
    no accelerations. If the aircraft begins to accelerate along any axis or
    axes (without rotating), the pilot will sense those accelerations. If
    any rotational moment is applied, the pilot will sense an acceleration
    due to that motion in the amount:

    [wdot X R]  +  [w X (w X R)]
    Term I          Term II

    where:

    wdot = omegadot, the rotational acceleration rate vector
    w    = omega, the rotational rate vector
    R    = the vector from the aircraft CG to the pilot eyepoint

    The sum total of these two terms plus the acceleration of the aircraft
    body axis gives the acceleration the pilot senses in inertial space.
    In the presence of a large body such as a planet, a gravity field also
    provides an accelerating attraction. This acceleration can be transformed
    from the reference frame of the planet so as to be expressed in the frame
    of reference of the aircraft. This gravity field accelerating attraction
    is felt by the pilot as a force on her tushie as she sits in her aircraft
    on the runway awaiting takeoff clearance.

    In JSBSim the acceleration of the body frame in inertial space is given
    by the F = ma relation. If the vForces vector is divided by the aircraft
    mass, the acceleration vector is calculated. The term wdot is equivalent
    to the JSBSim vPQRdot vector, and the w parameter is equivalent to vPQR.
