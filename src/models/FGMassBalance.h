/** Models weight, balance and moment of inertia information.

    Maintains a vector of point masses. Sums the contribution of all, and
    provides this to FGPropagate.  Loads the <mass_balance> section of the
    aircraft configuration file. There can be any number of <pointmasses>. Each
    can also have a shape which - if present - causes an associated moment of
    inertia to be calculated based on the shape. Note that a cylinder is solid,
    a tube is hollow, a ball is solid and a sphere is hollow.

    The inertia tensor must be specified in the structural frame (x axis
    positive aft, y axis positive out of the right wing and z axis upward). The
    sign of the inertia cross products are not modified by JSBSim so in most
    cases, negative values should be provided for <ixy>, <ixz> and <iyz>.
