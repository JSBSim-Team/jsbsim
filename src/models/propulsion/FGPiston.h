<h3>Definition of the piston engine configuration file parameters:</h3>
Basic parameters:
- \b minmp - this value is the nominal idle manifold pressure at sea-level
      without boost. Along with idlerpm, it determines throttle response slope.
- \b maxmp - this value is the nominal maximum manifold pressure at sea-level
      without boost. Along with maxrpm it determines the resistance of the
      aircraft intake system. Overridden by air-intake-impedance-factor
- \b man-press-lag - Delay in seconds for manifold pressure changes to take effect
- \b starter-torque - A value specifing the zero RPM torque in lb*ft the starter motor
      provides. Current default value is 40% of the horse power value.
- \b starter-rpm - A value specifing the maximum RPM the unloaded starter motor
      can achieve. Loads placed on the engine by the propeller and throttle will
      further limit RPM achieved in practice.
- \b idlerpm - this value affects the throttle fall off and the engine stops
      running if it is slowed below 80% of this value. The engine starts
      running when it reaches 80% of this value.
- \b maxrpm - this value is used to calculate air-box resistance and BSFC. It 
      also affects oil pressure among other things.
- \b maxhp - this value is the nominal power the engine creates at maxrpm. It
      will determine bsfc if that tag is not input. It also determines the
      starter motor power.
- \b displacement - this value is used to determine mass air and fuel flow
      which impacts engine power and cooling.
- \b cycles - Designate a 2 or 4 stroke engine. Currently only the 4 stroke
      engine is supported.
- \b bore - cylinder bore is currently unused.
- \b stroke - piston stroke is used to determine the mean piston speed. Longer
      strokes result in an engine that does not work as well at higher RPMs.
- \b compression-ratio - the compression ratio affects the change in volumetric
      efficiency with altitude.
- \b sparkfaildrop - this is the percentage drop in horsepower for single
      magneto operation.
- \b static-friction - this value is the power required to turn an engine that 
      is not running. Used to control and slow a windmilling propeller. Choose
      a small percentage of maxhp.

Advanced parameters
- \b bsfc - Indicated Specific Fuel Consumption. The power produced per unit of
      fuel. Higher numbers give worse fuel economy. This number may need to be
      lowered slightly from actual BSFC numbers because some internal engine 
      losses are modeled separately. Typically between 0.3 and 0.5
- \b volumetric-efficiency - the nominal volumetric efficiency of the engine.
      This is the primary way to control fuel flow  Boosted engines may require
      values above 1. Typical engines are 0.80 to 0.82
- \b air-intake-impedance-factor - this number is the pressure drop across the
      intake system. Increasing it reduces available manifold pressure. Also a 
      property for run-time adjustment.
- \b ram-air-factor - this number creates increases manifold pressure with an
      increase in dynamic pressure (aircraft speed).
      Also a property for run-time adjustment.

Cooling control:
- \b cylinders  - number of cylinders scales the cylinder head mass.
- \b cylinder-head-mass - the nominal mass of a cylinder head. A larger value
      slows changes in engine temperature
- \b cooling-factor - this number models the efficiency of the aircraft cooling
      system. Also a property for run-time adjustment.

Supercharge parameters:
- \b numboostspeed -  zero (or not present) for a naturally-aspirated engine,
      either 1, 2 or 3 for a boosted engine.  This corresponds to the number of
      supercharger speeds.  Merlin XII had 1 speed, Merlin 61 had 2, a late
      Griffon engine apparently had 3.  No known engine more than 3, although
      some German engines had continuously variable-speed superchargers.
- \b boostoverride - whether or not to clip output to the wastegate value
- \b boost-loss-factor - zero (or not present) for 'free' supercharging. A value entered
      will be used as a multiplier to the power required to compress the input air. Typical 
      value should be 1.15 to 1.20.
- \b boostmanual - whether a multispeed supercharger will manually or
      automatically shift boost speeds. On manual shifting the boost speeds is
      accomplished by controlling the property propulsion/engine/boostspeed.
- \b takeoffboost - boost in psi above sea level ambient. Typically used for
      takeoff, and emergency situations, generally for not more than five
      minutes.  This is a change in the boost control setting, not the actual
      supercharger speed, and so would only give extra power below the rated altitude.
      A typical takeoff boost for an early Merlin was about 12psi, compared
      with a rated boost of 9psi.

      When TAKEOFFBOOST is specified in the config file (and is above RATEDBOOST1), 
      the throttle position is interpreted as:
     - 0 to 0.98 : idle manifold pressure to rated boost (where attainable)
     - 0.99, 1.0 : takeoff boost (where attainable).

The next items are all appended with either 1, 2 or 3 depending on which
boostspeed they refer to:
- \b ratedboost[123] - the absolute rated boost above sea level ambient
      (14.7 PSI, 29.92 inHg) for a given boost speed.

- \b ratedpower[123] - unused
- \b ratedrpm[123] - The rpm at which rated boost is developed
- \b ratedaltitude[123] - The altitude up to which the rated boost can be
      maintained. Up to this altitude the boost is clipped to rated boost or
      takeoffboost. Beyond this altitude the manifold pressure must drop,
      since the supercharger is now at maximum unregulated output. The actual
      pressure multiplier of the supercharger system is calculated at
      initialization from this value.
