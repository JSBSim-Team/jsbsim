/** Models a generic rocket engine.
    The rocket engine is modeled given the following parameters:
    <ul>
        <li>Specific Impulse (in sec)</li>
    </ul>
    Additionally, the following control inputs, operating characteristics, and
    location are required, as with all other engine types:
    <ul>
        <li>Throttle setting (in percent, from 0 to 1.0)</li>
        <li>Maximum allowable throttle setting</li>
        <li>Minimum working throttle setting</li>
        <li>Sea level fuel flow at maximum thrust</li>
        <li>Sea level oxidizer flow at maximum thrust</li>
        <li>X, Y, Z location in structural coordinate frame</li>
        <li>Pitch and Yaw</li>
    </ul>
    The nozzle exit pressure (p2) is returned via a
    call to FGNozzle::GetPowerRequired(). This exit pressure is used
    to get the at-altitude thrust level.
    
    One can model the thrust of a solid rocket by providing a normalized thrust table
    as a function of time. For instance, the space shuttle solid rocket booster
    normalized thrust value looks roughly like this:

<pre>    
 \<thrust_table name="propulsion/thrust_time" type="internal">
   \<tableData>
      0.0   0.00
      0.2   0.91
      8.0   0.97
     16.0   0.99
     20.0   1.00
     21.0   1.00
     24.0   0.95
     32.0   0.85
     40.0   0.78
     48.0   0.72
     50.0   0.71
     52.0   0.71
     56.0   0.73
     64.0   0.78
     72.0   0.82
     80.0   0.81
     88.0   0.73
     96.0   0.69
    104.0   0.59
    112.0   0.46
    120.0   0.09
    132.0   0.00
   \</tableData>
 \</thrust_table>
</pre>

The left column is time, the right column is normalized thrust. Inside the
FGRocket class code, the maximum thrust is calculated, and multiplied by this
table. The Rocket class also tracks burn time. All that needs to be done is
for the rocket engine to be throttle up to 1. At that time, the solid rocket
fuel begins burning and thrust is provided.
