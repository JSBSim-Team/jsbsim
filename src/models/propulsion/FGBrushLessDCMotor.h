/** Models an electric brushless DC motor or more appropriately permanent magnet
    synchronous motor. as alternative to basic electric motor. 
BLDC motor code is based on basic "3 constant motor equations"
It require 3 basic physical motor properties (available from manufactures):
Kv speed motor constant      [RPM/Volt]
Rm internal coil resistance  [Ohms]
I0 no load current           [Amperes]
additional inputs :
maxvolts                     nominal voltage  from battery

Input format :
  <brushless_dc_motor>
    <maxvolts units="VOLTS">         {number} </maxvolts>
    <velocityconstant units="RPM/V"> {number} </velocityconstant>
    <coilresistance units="OHMS">    {number} </coilresistance>
    <noloadcurrent units="AMPERES">  {number} </noloadcurrent>
  </brushless_dc_motor>
