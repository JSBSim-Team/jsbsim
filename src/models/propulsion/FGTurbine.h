/** This class models a turbine engine.  Based on Jon Berndt's FGTurbine module.
    Here the term "phase" signifies the engine's mode of operation.  At any given
    time the engine is in only one phase.  At simulator startup the engine will be
    placed in the Trim phase in order to provide a simplified thrust value without
    throttle lag.  When trimming is complete the engine will go to the Off phase,
    unless the value FGEngine::Running has been previously set to true, in which
    case the engine will go to the Run phase.  Once an engine is in the Off phase
    the full starting procedure (or airstart) must be used to get it running.
<P>
    - STARTING (on ground):
      -# Set the control FGEngine::Starter to true.  The engine will spin up to
         a maximum of about %25 N2 (%5.2 N1). This value may be changed using the <startnX> parameter.
		 This simulates the action of a pneumatic starter.
      -# After reaching %15 N2 set the control FGEngine::Cutoff to false. If fuel
         is available the engine will now accelerate to idle.  The starter will
         automatically be set to false after the start cycle.
<P>
    - STARTING (in air):
      -# Increase speed to obtain a minimum of %15 N2.  If this is not possible,
         the starter may be used to assist.
      -# Place the control FGEngine::Cutoff to false.
<P>
    Ignition is assumed to be on anytime the Cutoff control is set to false,
    therefore a separate ignition system is not modeled.

<h3>Definition of the turbine engine configuration file parameters:</h3>

<pre>
  milthrust   - Maximum thrust, static, at sea level.
  maxthrust   - Afterburning thrust, static, at sea level.
  bypassratio - Ratio of bypass air flow to core air flow.
  bleed       - Thrust reduction factor due to losses (0.0 to 1.0).
  tsfc        - Thrust-specific fuel consumption at cruise, lbm/hr/lbf
  atsfc       - Afterburning TSFC, lbm/hr/lbf
  ignitionn1  - Fan rotor rpm (% of max) while starting
  ignitionn2  - Core rotor rpm (% of max) while starting
  idlen1      - Fan rotor rpm (% of max) at idle
  idlen2      - Core rotor rpm (% of max) at idle
  n1spinup    - Fan rotor rpm starter acceleration to ignitionn1 value (default 1.0)
  n2spinup    - Core rotor rpm starter acceleration to ignitionn2 value (default 3.0)
  n1startrate - Fan rotor rpm time taken to accelerate from ignitionn1 to idlen1 value (default 1.4)
  n2startrate - Core rotor rpm time taken to accelerate to ignitionn2 idlen2 value (default 2.0)
  n1spindown  - Factor used in calculation for fan rotor time to spool down to zero (default 2.0)
  n2spindown  - Factor used in calculation for core rotor time to spool down to zero (default 2.0)
  maxn1       - Fan rotor rpm (% of max) at full throttle 
  maxn2       - Core rotor rpm (% of max) at full throttle
  augmented
              0 = afterburner not installed
              1 = afterburner installed
  augmethod
              0 = afterburner activated by property /engines/engine[n]/augmentation
              1 = afterburner activated by pushing throttle above 99% position
              2 = throttle range is expanded in the FCS, and values above 1.0 are afterburner range
  injected
              0 = Water injection not installed
              1 = Water injection installed
  injection-time - Time, in seconds, of water injection duration 
  InjN1increment - % increase in N1 when injection is taking place
  InjN2increment - % increase in N2 when injection is taking place
  disable-windmill - flag that disables engine windmilling when off if true
</pre>

<h3>NOTES:</h3>  
<pre>
    Bypass ratio is used only to estimate engine acceleration time.  The
    effect of bypass ratio on engine efficiency is already included in
    the TSFC value.  Feel free to set this parameter (even for turbojets) to
    whatever value gives a desired spool-up rate. Default value is 0.

    The bleed factor is multiplied by thrust to give a resulting thrust
    after losses.  This can represent losses due to bleed, or any other cause.
    Default value is 0.  A common value would be 0.04.

    Nozzle position, for variable area exhaust nozzles, is provided for users
    needing to drive a nozzle gauge or animate a virtual nozzle.

    This model can only be used with the "direct" thruster.  See the file:
    /engine/direct.xml
