### Configuration Parameters

<pre>
    \<ixx>           - Propeller rotational inertia.
    \<diameter>      - Propeller disk diameter.
    \<numblades>     - Number of blades.
    \<gearratio>     - Ratio of (engine rpm) / (prop rpm).
    \<minpitch>      - Minimum blade pitch angle.
    \<maxpitch>      - Maximum blade pitch angle.
    \<minrpm>        - Minimum rpm target for constant speed propeller.
    \<maxrpm>        - Maximum rpm target for constant speed propeller.
    \<constspeed>    - 1 = constant speed mode, 0 = manual pitch mode. 
    \<reversepitch>  - Blade pitch angle for reverse.
    \<sense>         - Direction of rotation (1=clockwise as viewed from cockpit,
                        -1=anti-clockwise as viewed from cockpit). Sense is
                       specified in the parent tag of the propeller.
    \<p_factor>      - P factor. It is specified in the parent tag of
                       the propeller.
    \<ct_factor>     - A multiplier for the coefficients of thrust.
    \<cp_factor>     - A multiplier for the coefficients of power.
</pre>

Two tables are needed. One for coefficient of thrust (Ct) and one for
coefficient of power (Cp).

Two tables are optional. They apply a factor to Ct and Cp based on the
helical tip Mach.

The parameters <sense> and <p_factor> must be specified at the parent level i.e.
in the <thruster> element. This allows to specify different sense and P factor
values for each propeller of the model while using the same definition file for
all the propellers.

In addition to thrust, the propeller applies two moments to the aircraft:
- The torque that tends to roll the aircraft in the direction opposite to the
propeller rotation,
- and the gyroscopic moment.

It should be noted that historically the gyroscopic moment had an incorrect
sign. The correct sign can be obtained by specifying a **version** attribute
higher than 1.0 to the propeller definition
~~~.xml
<propeller name="a_prop" version="1.1">
  <!-- propeller definition -->
</propeller>
~~~
For backward compatibility, the absence of the **version** attribute will result
in the gyroscopic moment to be computed with the legacy incorrect sign.
