/** Models an electric motor.
    FGElectric models an electric motor based on the configuration file
    \<power> parameter.  The throttle controls motor output linearly from
    zero to \<power>.  This power value (converted internally to horsepower)
    is then used by FGPropeller to apply torque to the propeller.  At present
    there is no battery model available, so this motor does not consume any
    energy.  There is no internal friction.
