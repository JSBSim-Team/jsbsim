/** Models the MSIS-00 atmosphere.
    This is a wrapper for the NRL-MSIS-00 model 2001:

    This C++ format model wraps the NRLMSISE-00 C source code package - release
    20020503
 
    The NRLMSISE-00 model was developed by Mike Picone, Alan Hedin, and
    Doug Drob. They also wrote a NRLMSISE-00 distribution package in 
    FORTRAN which is available at
    http://uap-www.nrl.navy.mil/models_web/msis/msis_home.htm
 
    Dominik Brodowski implemented and maintains this C version. You can
    reach him at devel@brodo.de. See the file "DOCUMENTATION" for details,
    and check http://www.brodo.de/english/pub/nrlmsise/index.html for
    updated releases of this package.

 *   NOTES ON INPUT VARIABLES:

 *      model and are not of equal importance for every situation.  
 *      For the most physically realistic calculation these three
 *      variables should be consistent (lst=sec/3600 + g_long/15).
 *      The Equation of Time departures from the above formula
 *      for apparent local time can be included if available but
 *      are of minor importance.
 *
 *      f107 and f107A values used to generate the model correspond
 *      to the 10.7 cm radio flux at the actual distance of the Earth
 *      from the Sun rather than the radio flux at 1 AU. The following
 *      site provides both classes of values:
 *      ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR_DATA/SOLAR_RADIO/FLUX/
 *
 *      f107, f107A, and ap effects are neither large nor well
 *      established below 80 km and these parameters should be set to
 *      150., 150., and 4. respectively.
