/** Models the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere, with the ability to modify the 
    temperature and pressure. A base feature of the model is the temperature 
    profile that is stored as an FGTable object with this data:

  282152.2    336.5; //   84.852      86.000
@endcode

The pressure is calculated at lower altitudes through the use of two equations
that are presented in the U.S. Standard Atmosphere document (see references).
Density, kinematic viscosity, speed of sound, etc., are all calculated based
on various constants and temperature and pressure. At higher altitudes (above 
86 km (282152 ft) a different and more complicated method of calculating
pressure is used.
The temperature may be modified through the use of several methods. Ultimately,
these access methods allow the user to modify the sea level standard temperature,
and/or the sea level standard pressure, so that the entire profile will be 
consistently and accurately calculated.
