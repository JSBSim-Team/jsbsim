/** Encapsulates a PID control component for the flight control system.

<h3>Configuration Format:</h3>

@code
<pid name="{string}" [type="standard"]>
  <input> {[-]property} </input>
  <kp> {number|[-]property} </kp>
  <ki type="rect|trap|ab2|ab3"> {number|[-]property} </ki>
  <kd> {number|[-]property} </kd>
  <trigger> {property} </trigger>
  <pvdot> {property} </pvdot>
</pid>
@endcode

For the integration constant element, one can also supply the type attribute for
what kind of integrator to be used, one of:

- rect, for a rectangular integrator
- trap, for a trapezoidal integrator
- ab2, for a second order Adams Bashforth integrator
- ab3, for a third order Adams Bashforth integrator

For example,

@code
<pid name="fcs/heading-control">
  <input> fcs/heading-error </input>
  <kp> 3 </kp>
  <ki type="ab3"> 1 </ki>
  <kd> 1 </kd>
</pid>
@endcode

<h3>Configuration Parameters:</h3>

  The values of kp, ki, and kd have slightly different interpretations depending
  on whether the PID controller is a standard one, or an ideal/parallel one -
  with the latter being the default.

  By default, the PID controller computes the derivative as being the slope of
  the line joining the value of the previous input to the value of the current
  input. However if a better estimation can be determined for the derivative,
  you can provide its value to the PID controller via the property supplied in
  pvdot.
  
  kp      - Proportional constant, default value 0.
  ki      - Integrative constant, default value 0.
  kd      - Derivative constant, default value 0.
  trigger - Property which is used to sense wind-up, optional. Most often, the
            trigger will be driven by the "saturated" property of a particular
            actuator. When the relevant actuator has reached it's limits (if
            there are any, specified by the <clipto> element) the automatically
            generated saturated property will be greater than zero (true). If
            this property is used as the trigger for the integrator, the
            integrator will not continue to integrate while the property is
            still true (> 1), preventing wind-up.
            The integrator can also be reset to 0.0 if the property is set to a
            negative value.
  pvdot   - The property to be used as the process variable time derivative.
