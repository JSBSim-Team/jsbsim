Definition of the gas cell configuration file parameters:
- <b>type</b> -
    One of HYDROGEN, HELIUM or AIR.
- <b>location</b> -
    Location of cell center in the aircraft's structural frame.
    Currently this is were the forces of the cell is applied.
- <b>{x|y|z}_radius</b> -
    Radius along in the respective direction (both ends).
- <b>{x|y|z}_width</b> -
    Width in the respective direction.
    <b>NOTE:</b> A 'x', 'y', 'z'-radius/width combination must be specified.
- <b>fullness</b> -
    Initial fullness of the cell, normally [0,1],
    values >1 initialize the cell at pressure.
- <b>max_overpressure</b> -
    Maximum cell overpressure (excess is automatically valved off).
- <b>valve_coefficient</b> -
    Capacity of the manual valve. The valve is
    considered to be located at the top of the cell.
    The valve coefficient determine the flow out
    of the cell according to:
    <i>dVolume/dt = ValveCoefficient * DeltaPressure</i>.
- <b>heat</b> -
    Zero or more FGFunction:s describing the heat flow from
    the atmosphere into the gas cell.
    Unit: [lb ft / (sec Rankine)].
    If there are no heat transfer functions at all the gas cell
    temperature will equal that of the surrounding atmosphere.
    A constant function returning 0 results in adiabatic behaviour.
- <b>ballonet</b> -
    Zero or more ballonets, i.e. air bags inside the gas cell.
    Ballonets are used to maintain the volume of the gas cell
    and keep its internal pressure higher than that of the
    surrounding environment.
  - <b>location</b> -
      Location of ballonet center in the aircraft's structural frame.
  - <b>{x|y|z}_radius</b> -
      Radius along in the respective direction (both ends).
  - <b>{x|y|z}_width</b> -
      Width in the respective direction.
  - <b>max_overpressure</b> -
      Maximum ballonet overpressure (excess is automatically valved off).
  - <b>valve_coefficient</b> -
      Capacity of the exit valve between the ballonet
      and the atmosphere. The valve coefficient
      determine the flow out of the cell according to:
      <i>dVolume/dt = ValveCoefficient * DeltaPressure</i>.
  - <b>heat</b> -
      Zero or more FGFunction:s describing the heat flow from
      the enclosing gas cell into the ballonet.
      Unit: [lb ft / (sec Rankine)]
  - <b>blower_input</b> -
      One FGFunction describing the air flow into the
      ballonet. Unit: [ft<sup>3</sup> / sec] (at the temperature and
      pressure of the ballonet.)
